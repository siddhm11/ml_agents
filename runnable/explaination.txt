# Multi-Agent ML System Requirements

## Overview
I have a working single ML agent (`CSVMLAgent`) that performs end-to-end ML pipeline on CSV data. I want to create a hierarchical multi-agent system where one coordinator agent calls two sub-agents to predict different columns from the same dataset.

## Current Agent Structure
- Uses LangGraph with `AgentState` (TypedDict with dataclass decorator)
- Pipeline: csv_loader → initial_inspection → data_quality_assessment → problem_identification → feature_analysis → algorithm_recommendation → preprocessing_strategy → model_training → evaluation_analysis → final_recommendation
- The `problem_identification_node` currently determines the target column using LLM analysis with intelligent fallbacks

## Required Architecture

### 1. Coordinator Agent
- **Purpose**: Orchestrate two sub-agents to predict different columns
- **State Structure (`CoordinatorState`)**:
  - `csv_path`: Input CSV file path
  - `raw_data`: Loaded DataFrame
  - `data_info`: Dataset metadata
  - `selected_columns`: List of 2 chosen target columns
  - `agent1_results` & `agent2_results`: Results from each sub-agent
  - `model_paths`: Dictionary mapping agent names to model file paths
  - `selected_features`: Dictionary mapping column names to their selected features
  - `error_messages`: List of errors
  - `final_summary`: Combined results summary

### 2. Column Selection Logic
- **Automatic Detection**: LLM-based node that analyzes dataset to pick 2 most interesting columns for ML
- **Criteria**: Any 2 columns that make good ML targets (regression or classification)
- **LLM Analysis**: Should consider column types, distributions, and business relevance
- **No Manual Specification**: Fully automated selection

### 3. Sub-Agent Configuration
- **Base**: Modified version of existing `CSVMLAgent`
- **Input**: Full dataset + pre-specified target column
- **Modification**: Accept target column parameter, bypass target selection in `problem_identification_node`
- **Independence**: Each sub-agent runs complete ML pipeline independently
- **Features**: LLM-based feature selection must be saved (different for each target)

### 4. Execution Flow
- **Sequential**: Run sub-agents one after another (not parallel)
- **Workflow**: `csv_loader → column_selection → agent1_execution → agent2_execution → results_aggregation`
- **Error Handling**: If one sub-agent fails, the other should still continue
- **State Management**: 3 separate states (1 coordinator + 2 sub-agents)

### 5. Model Storage
- **Format**: Use joblib for model serialization
- **Paths**: Store models in different locations (e.g., `models/agent1_<column_name>_model.pkl`)
- **Features**: Save selected features separately for each model

### 6. Results Integration
- **Storage**: Keep sub-agent results separate in coordinator state
- **Aggregation**: Simple storage approach (no complex combination needed)
- **Output**: Final summary combining both agents' results

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Existing `problem_identification_node` handles target column selection via LLM with robust fallbacks
- `csv_loader_node` handles file loading with encoding detection and separator inference
- Need to modify sub-agent initialization to accept pre-specified target column
- Coordinator should create new instances of modified `CSVMLAgent` for each sub-agent
- All agents use the same LLM client and basic architecture

## Key Requirements Summary
1. **Automatic**: No manual column specification
2. **Hierarchical**: 1 coordinator → 2 sub-agents
3. **Independent**: Each sub-agent gets full dataset, focuses on assigned target
4. **Sequential**: Run agents one after another
5. **Robust**: Continue if one agent fails
6. **Flexible**: Handle any CSV with 2+ suitable target columns
7. **Storage**: Save models and features separately for each agent

Comprehensive Problem Statement & Requirements
Current System Overview
I have built a robust ML automation agent (CSVMLAgent) using LangGraph with a 10-node workflow that combines statistical analysis with LLM intelligence (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B). The agent handles the complete ML pipeline from CSV ingestion to model recommendations, with sophisticated fallback mechanisms for reliability.
Current Architecture:

Hybrid Intelligence: Statistical preprocessing + LLM-powered decision making
State Management: TypedDict-based AgentState tracking all workflow data
Error Handling: Multi-layer fallbacks (LLM → statistical → heuristic)
Node Structure: 10 sequential nodes covering data loading, quality assessment, problem identification, feature analysis, algorithm recommendation, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and final recommendations

Technical Challenge
The current agent is generalized for all ML tasks, which creates inefficiencies:

Algorithm recommendations include irrelevant options for specific problem types
Feature analysis uses generic approaches instead of problem-specific techniques
Evaluation metrics are generalized rather than optimized for regression vs classification
Problem identification runs unnecessarily when the task type is pre-determined

Proposed Solution Architecture
Goal: Create a specialized multi-agent system that maintains the robustness of the current system while optimizing for specific ML task types.
Components:

MLCoordinator:

Runs only problem identification to determine task type and target variable
Routes datasets to appropriate specialist agents
Maintains stateless operation with optional caching


Specialized Agents (inheriting from base MLAgent):

RegressionAgent: Optimized for continuous target prediction
ClassificationAgent: Optimized for categorical target prediction


Base Class Extraction:

Extract MLAgent base class from current CSVMLAgent
Preserve all existing functionality and error handling
Enable method overriding for specialization



Technical Requirements
Inheritance Strategy:

Use exact method signature inheritance (Option A)
Override specific nodes while maintaining interface compatibility
Preserve existing LLM integration and fallback mechanisms

Node Specializations Required:

algorithm_recommendation_node: Filter algorithm pools by problem type
feature_analysis_node: Apply problem-specific feature analysis techniques
evaluation_analysis_node: Use specialized metrics (R²/MSE for regression, F1/Accuracy for classification)
problem_identification_node: Skip execution when target is coordinator-assigned

State Management:

Extend existing AgentState with minimal additions: agent_type, coordinator_assigned, target_override
Maintain backward compatibility with current state schema

Workflow Modifications:

Conditional logic in nodes based on coordinator assignment
Light validation for assigned target variables (log warnings, continue processing)
Preserve 10-node workflow structure with specialized implementations

Implementation Specifications
File Organization:

├── regression_agent.py     # RegressionAgent(MLAgent)
├── classification_agent.py # ClassificationAgent(MLAgent)
└── coordinator.py          # MLCoordinator
Cross-Validation Strategy:

RegressionAgent: KFold for continuous targets
ClassificationAgent: StratifiedKFold for balanced class distribution

LLM Configuration:

Temperature: 0.1 for deterministic outputs
Token limit: 4000+ as needed for complex prompts
Preserve existing error handling and JSON parsing logic

Key Design Principles:

Simplicity: Maintain clean, understandable architecture
Robustness: Preserve all existing fallback mechanisms
Efficiency: Eliminate unnecessary processing for known problem types
Maintainability: Keep inheritance hierarchy shallow and logical
Compatibility: Ensure base functionality remains intact

Expected Outcomes

Faster processing for pre-determined problem types
More relevant algorithm recommendations

Appropriate evaluation metrics for each problem type
Maintained reliability through preserved error handling

Implementation Priority
